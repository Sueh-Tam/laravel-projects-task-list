About the Project: 

My project is a web application built with laravel. My project allows users to manage tasks, which are units of work that need to be done. Users can create tasks by providing a name, a description, and a full description of the task. Users can also read tasks by viewing their details, such as the name, the description, and the full description. Users can edit tasks by changing their name, description, or full description. Users can delete tasks by removing them from the database.
